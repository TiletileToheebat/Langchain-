This decisive policy shift carries with it a multitude of implications that warrant rigorous investigation to \\ncomprehend its far-reaching consequences. The core problem at the heart of this study lies in uncovering the intricate web of \\nimpacts – positive, negative, direct, and indirect – that arise from the subsidy removal and examining their ramifications for \\nboth the Nigerian economy and society.  The subsidy removal, while driven by the intent to align with global trends of fossil \\nfuel subsidy reduction and enhance fiscal sustainability (Al Jazeera, 2023), presents a host of challenges. Foremost among \\nthese challenges is the potential exacerbation of socio -economic inequality, given that subsidy removal can lead to increased \\nfuel prices and a subsequent rise in the cost of living. This predicament echoes the concern raised by Ude (2023), emphasizing \\nthat while subsidy elimination might hold long -term benefits, it can strain the financial resources of households, particularly \\nthose already marginalized. \\nThe structural underpinnings of Nigeria's economy introduce additional layers of complexity. The existing state of the country's \\nrefineries, coupled with a dependency on imported oil, elevates the risk of escalated fuel prices. The delicate balance  between \\nencouraging domestic refining capacities and managing consumer costs warrants a detailed examination, considering that the \\nsubsidy removal could amplify the challenges posed by an underperforming domestic refining sector.  Moreover, the subsidy \\nremoval's impact on public services and infrastructure requires thorough investigation. The anticipated redirection of funds \\nfrom subsidies to public goods such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure holds the potential for positive transformation. \\nHowever, the effective utilization of these funds and their equitable distribution must be closely scrutinized. Ensuring that the \\nremoval leads to tangible improvements in these areas without causing unintended negative consequences becomes a central \\nconcern. \\nThe complexity of the problem is magnified by the dynamic interplay between economic, political, environmental, and societal \\nfactors. The removal of the fuel subsidy in Nigeria in 2023 presents a multi -faceted problem characterized by intricate links \"),\n",

The intricate relationships \\nbetween these dimensions necessitate an integrated approach that acknowledges the potential trade -offs and synergies. \\nUnravelling the implications of this decision requires a nuanced analysis that considers the diverse dynamics at play. The \\noverarching aim of this study is to address these complexities and provide insights that contribute to a holistic understanding \\nof the impacts of subs idy removal on the Nigerian economy and society.  Understanding these complexities is paramount for \\npolicymakers, enabling them to make informed decisions that balance the short-term impacts with the long-term benefits and \\nminimize disruptions to the vulnerable population. \\nIn the literature, several studies have probed into the impacts of subsidy removal (e.g., Nwafor et al. 2006; Osunmuyiwa & \\nKalfagianni, 2016; Greve & Lay, 2023; and Harring et al., 2023). In the context of assessing the impact of subsidy r emoval on \\nthe poor, Nwafor, Ogujiuba, and Asogwa (2006) employ a computable general equilibrium analysis. Their study digs into the \\nquestion of whether subsidy removal disproportionately affects the economically vulnerable segments of the population. This \\nresearch illuminates the intricate balance between fiscal policy, subsidy removal, and social equity, indicating that while \\nsubsidy removal can have fiscal implications, it is crucial to consider its distributive effects. Also, Osunmuyiwa and Kalfagianni \\n(2017) delve into the broader energy context, examining whether Nigeria's fuel subsidy reforms can act as a catalyst for energy \\ntransitions. Their research underscores that subsidy removal can lead to shifts in energy consumption patterns, affecting \\ngovernment revenue and expenditures through changes in the energy sector's dynamics. By exploring the complex relationship \\nbetween subsidy removal, energy transitions, and fiscal dynamics, this study emphasizes the need for a comprehensive \\nunderstanding of how po licy changes reverberate throughout the economy. While these previous studies have shed light on \\nthe economic and environmental consequences of various subsidy removal efforts, there is limited exploration of the effects of \\nthe 2023 subsidy removal in Nige ria. Understanding these potential challenges, opportunities, and the need  for holistic \\napproaches is crucial for devising effective strategies that garner public support, mitigate potential social unrest, and ensure \\nthe long-term sustainability of the policy change. \\nThe study makes significant contributions to our understanding of the multifaceted implications of fuel subsidy removal. The \\nstudy's holistic analysis and nuanced insights into the diverse dimensions of subsidy removal offer a comprehensive foundation \\nfor informed decision -making, fostering equitable economic growth, social welfare, and environmental sustainability. By \\nproviding a comprehensive analysis across economic, social, and environmental dimensions, the study equips policymakers \\nwith a nuanced perspective to navigate the complexities of subsidy reform. The findings offer valuable insights into potentia l \\nchallenges, opportunities, and the need for holistic approaches that balance economic development, social welfare, a nd \\nenvironmental stewardship. \\nMoreover, the study's implications extend beyond Nigeria's borders, serving as a reference point for other nations grappling \\nwith subsidy reform or seeking sustainable energy transition strategies. Researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders can draw \\nfrom the synthesized findings to make informed decisions that align with global efforts toward mitigating climate change, \\nfostering inclusive economic growth, and ensuring equitable societal outcomes. As subsidy reform continues to be a pertinent \\nglobal issue, this study contributes significantly to the collective understanding of its consequences and the strategies required \\nto achieve a sustainable and prosperous future. \\n \\n2 Literature Review \\nThe literature review schedule in Table 1 provides a concise overview of the research objectives, methodologies used, and key \\nresults or implications from each of the selected sources, highlighting the diverse dimensions and impacts of subsidy removal \\nacross different contexts. In the thematic analysis of the literature on the effects of subsidy removal, several key themes emerge \\nacross the various studies. These themes encompass the diverse objectives, methodologies, and results of the research. Several \\nstudies, such as Aryanpur et al. (2022) and Jewell et al. (2018), focus on the environmental and economic implications of \\nsubsidy removal. Integrated energy systems modelling suggests that subsidy removal can lead to emissions reduction, energy \\nefficiency improvements, and economic benefits. However, Jewell et al. (2018) caution that emission reductions resulting from \\nsubsidy removal are limited, particularly in energy-exporting regions. \\nThe distributional effects of subsidy removal are another recurring theme. Bhattacharyya and Ganguly (2017) highlight how \\ncross subsidy removal in electricity pricing can influence consumption patterns, energy efficiency, and distributional equity . \\nSimilarly, Labeaga et al. (2021) and Feng et al. (2018) explore how energy taxation and subsidy removal can impact povert y \\nrates and income distribution, respectively. These studies underline the importance of considering the equity implications of  \\nsubsidy removal policies.  Some studies, like Majekodunmi (2013) and Chiluwa (2015), delve into the social and political \\ndimensions of subsidy removal. Majekodunmi (2013) highlights the political economy surrounding fuel subsidy removal, \\nincluding public protests and government decisions. On the other hand, Chiluwa (2015) focuses on the role of social media in \\nshaping public discour se during fuel subsidy removal protests, illustrating the interplay between technology and social \\nmovements. \\nThe effects of subsidy removal are also examined in sectoral and regional contexts. Bazilian and Onyeji (2012) shed light on \\nhow inadequate public power supply combined with fossil fuel subsidy removal can negatively impact businesses. Rosas-Flores \\net al. (2017) investigate the distributional effects of subsidy removal and carbon taxes on Mexican households , revealing \\nvarying impacts on income distribution and household welfare. These studies emphasize that the impacts of subsidy removal \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './data/Evansetal.2023SubsidyRemoval.pdf', 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content=\"14       EVANS ET AL.  \\n \\ncan be context -specific and require tailored policy approaches.  The theme of public acceptance and behavioural aspects is \\nexplored by studies such as Harring et al. (2023) and Abd Obaida et al. (2020). Harring et al. (2023) analyse cross-national \\nattitudes towards subsidy removal, revealing that attitudes are influenced by socio-economic factors and the energy transition \\ncontext. Abd Obaida et al. (2020) investigate the moderating role of subsidy removal on SMEs' tax compliance behaviour, \\nsuggesting that subsidy removal can shape businesses' tax compliance practices. \\nIn a nutshell, the literature demonstrates the multifaceted nature of the effects of subsidy removal, spanning environmental, \\neconomic, distributional, social, and behavioural dimensions. The studies collectively provide insights into the complexities \\nsurrounding subsidy removal policies and underscore the importan ce of holistic analyses when considering their \\nimplementation. While these previous studies have shed light on the economic and environmental consequences of various \\nsubsidy removal, there appears to be a limited exploration of the potential challenges, opportunities, and the need for the 2023 \\nsubsidy removal in Nigeria. The current study fills the gap. \\nTable 1.

These framew orks provide valuable insights into the complexities of subsidy removal, \\nshedding light on both anticipated and unintended consequences. \\nEconomic theories play a crucial role in understanding subsidy removal's economic implications. One such framework is the \\nRational Choice Theory, which posits that individuals act to maximize their self-interests within constraints (Van Valkengoed \\n& Van der Werff, 2022). In the context of subsidy removal, this theory can explain how consumers react to price increases by \\naltering their consumption patterns. Data from Nigeria's 2012 subsidy  removal protests reveals shifts in consumer behaviour \\ndue to sudden fuel price hikes (Apeloko & Olajide, 2012).  \\nPolitical theories offer insights into how government decisions on subsidy removal are influenced by power dynamics and \\npublic opinion. The Public Choice Theory argues that political actors aim to maximize their interests, leading to policies that \\nmay not always align with the public's welfare (Obasi et al., 2017). This theory can explain the rivalry between citizens' interests \\nand government decisions in both the 2012 and 2023 cases of subsidy removal in Nigeria.  \\nSocial theories illuminate the societal repercussions of subsidy removal. The Theory of Social Conflict explains how societal  \\ngroups with differing interests may engage in conflict when policies threaten their well -being (Apeloko & Olajide, 2012). The \\nTheory provides a lens through which an analysis of the tensions and clashes that arise when policies like subsidy removal have \\ndifferential impacts on various societal groups  can be carried out . It underscores the importance of considering not only the \\neconomic implications of such policies but also their social and distributional effects. By understanding these dynamics, \\npolicymakers can anticipate and address potential conflicts, striving for policy solutions that are more equitable and social ly \\nacceptable. \\nEnvironmental theories consider the ecological effects of subsidy removal, particularly relevant in the context of climate action. \\nThe theory of Ecological Modernization examines how policy shifts can lead to more sustainable practices, including reduced  \\nfossil fuel consumption (Van Valkengoed & Van der Werff, 2022).  The theory proposes that societies can transition toward \\ngreater environmental sustainability through a process of modernization that integrates ecological considerations into \\neconomic and policy decisions. It suggests that technological innovations, shifts in production methods, and changes in societal \\nvalues can collectively contribute to reducing environmental impacts. In the context of subsidy removal, this theory becomes \\nrelevant as it prompts a consideration of how the removal of subsidies on fossil fuels could incentivize the adoption of cleaner \\nenergy sources and more energy-efficient technologies. \\nIn short, a multi-dimensional analysis of subsidy removal necessitates the application of  various theories. Economic theories \\nilluminate market dynamics and consumer behaviour, social theories reveal societal implications, and environmental theories \\naddress ecological consequences. By integrating insights from these frameworks and grounding the analysis in empirical data, \\na comprehensive understanding of the 2023 subsidy removal case in Nigeria can be achieved. \\n \\n4 Methodology \\nDrawing inspiration from Rashid et al. (2019), who outline the case study method as a step -by-step guide for business \\nresearchers, this study employs a case study approach to dig deep into the multi -faceted impacts of subsidy removal on the \\nNigerian economy and society. This method is particularly suited to understanding complex real -life phenomena within their \\ncontextual settings. Data collection for this study is supported by qualitative research methodologies, primarily employing \\nthematic analysis. Braun and Clarke (2022) emphasize the significance of conceptual and design thinking in implementing \\nthematic analysis, promoti ng a structured approach to uncover patterns and meaning within the data. The utilization of \\nthematic analysis aligns with the study's aim of comprehensively exploring the multi -faceted impacts of subsidy removal on \\nthe Nigerian economy and society. \"),\n",

The initial phase of this study encompassed an exhaustive review of pertin ent \\nliterature spanning economics, sociology, political science, and related disciplines. Academic databases, scholarly articles, \\nreports, and reputable sources were scrutinized to comprehend existing theories, models, and conceptual frameworks \\npertinent to subsidy removal and its repercussions on economies and societies. This iterative process aided in identifying ke y \\nthemes, knowledge gaps, and avenues for theoretical exploration. \\nThe core methodology involved theoretical analysis and synthesis, driven by logical reasoning and deduction. Analogies, \\ncomparative analyses, and logical extrapolations were used to predict potential outcomes and patterns. Throughout t he \\nprocess, feedback from experts in economics, sociology, and Nigerian studies was solicited to ensure the robustness and \\nrelevance of the conceptual framework. Peers and mentors also provided valuable insights and critiques, aiding in refining the \\nframework and strengthening the theoretical arguments presented. This iterative dialogue enriched the depth and breadth of \\nthe analysis. \\n \\n5 Case Study: The 2023 Fuel Subsidy Removal \\n5.1 Context and Reactions \\nThe historical context of fuel subsidies in Nigeria, as docu mented by Houeland (2020), reveals their long -standing presence \\nas measures to mitigate global oil price shocks. The subsidization of petrol prices has been institutionalized since the 1970 s, \\nprimarily to shield citizens from volatile energy costs. This hi storical backdrop underscores the need for a cautious approach \\nto subsidy removal, particularly in a developing nation like Nigeria. The decision by Nigeria to remove its consumer fuel subsidy \\nin 2023 therefore has significant economic, social, and environ mental implications that must be carefully considered. The \\nannouncement reflects a growing acknowledgment of the challenges posed by fossil fuel subsidies and the need for equitable \\nand sustainable reforms. The move to remove subsidies aligns with a broader global trend toward subsidy elimination to fulfil \\nclimate change obligations and promote fiscal sustainability. \\nThe context of the 2023 subsidy removal in Nigeria is multifaceted. The new president, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, cited concerns \\nthat the subsidy scheme disproportionately benefited the wealthy while escalating costs became increasingly unjustifiable. This \\nhighlights a crucial aspect of subsidy removal – addressing inequality and ensuring that the most vulnerable segments of the \\npopulation are not adversely affected. The subsidy removal, while potentially reducing carbon emissions, can lead to increased \\neconomic pressure on the population, as pointed out by Ude (2023). \\nThe structure of Nigeria's subsidy system involves fixing the price of petrol for consumers below international prices and using \\ngovernment resources to cover the difference. Given that Nigeria's refineries are in a state of decay, imported oil prices tend to \\nbe higher than they would be if the products were refined domestically. This struc tural issue has contributed to the perceived \\nunsustainability of the subsidy programme. The decision to raise the price of petrol by 200% shortly after the subsidy removal \\nannouncement underscores the immediate impact on consumers and the broader economy. \\nThe potential benefits of subsidy removal, as highlighted by the government, include increased resources for public \\ninfrastructure, education, and healthcare. This aligns with the prevailing global perspective that fuel subsidies often lead to \\ninefficiencies and financial leakages, ultimately detracting from other crucial areas of development. The reported staggering \\nmonthly expenditure of $1.22billion on petrol subsidies, surpassing allocations for education, health, and infrastructure, \\nunderscores the need for fiscal reallocation and prioritization. \\nThe chronology of events and reactions surrounding the 2023 fuel subsidy removal in Nigeria paints a complex picture of \\neconomic, political, and societal dynamics. The announcement of the subsidy's removal during President Bola Ahmed Tinubu's \\ninauguration set off a chain reaction that elicited public outcry and governmental responses. Slated to take effect on July 1, the \\npolicy prompted immediate concerns and chaos, with citizens scrambling to purchase fuel befo re prices surged (Al Jazeera, \\n2023). The economic implications of the fuel subsidy removal were substantial. The retail fuel price was anticipated to rise \\nfrom the official pump price of 185 naira ($0.40) to a range between 350 ($0.76) and 550 naira ($1.18 ). Given that about 133 \\nmillion Nigerians were living in multidimensional poverty (United Nations data), the impact on their lives was palpable (Al \\nJazeera, 2023). \\nThe roots of the fuel subsidy ran deep in Nigeria's history. The country's oil was refined i n Europe and then imported back, \\nincurring higher costs. To alleviate this financial burden on consumers, the government provided subsidies. This subsidy was \\nintricately linked to fuel prices and consequently influenced the costs of almost all goods and se rvices within the nation. \\nOriginating in the 1970s as a response to volatile global oil prices, the subsidy became deeply entrenched, eventually evolvi ng \\ninto a substantial fiscal burden on the government (Al Jazeera, 2023). \\nThe sentiment surrounding the fuel subsidy had been both popular and contentious. Previous attempts to remove it were met \\nwith resistance due to perceived citizen benefits. The 2012 effort to remove the subsidy under then -President Goodluck \\nJonathan led to nationwide protests, organized  by labour unions, civil society, and opposition party leaders, including Bola \\nAhmed Tinubu. The resulting demonstrations brought the nation to a standstill, compelling the government to reduce fuel \\nprices and reinstate the subsidy (Al Jazeera, 2023). \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './data/Evansetal.2023SubsidyRemoval.pdf', 'page': 7, 'page_label': '8'}, page_content=\"18       EVANS ET AL.  \\n \\nHowever, corruption and a lack of fiscal transparency plagued subsidy payments. A parliamentary inquiry in 2012 exposed a \\n$6 billion fraud involving officials at the state -run Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC). This fuelled demands for \\ninvestigations into NNPC and a re-evaluation of subsidy payments (Al Jazeera, 2023). \\nIn the lead -up to the February 2023 election, all major presidential candidates pledged to remove the subsidy and enact oil \\nsector reforms, indicating political consensus on the matter. Given Nigeria's economic realities, experts deemed the subsidy \\nremoval necessary. The preceding Buhari administration had left a significant debt, necessitating financial prudence. Despite  \\nopposition from labour unions, the government's decision to eliminate the subsidy was seen as economically prudent, although \\ncalls to reduce wasteful government spending grew more prominent (Al Jazeera, 2023). \\nReactions to the subsidy removal were mixed. NNPC Limited welcomed the move, citing the government's substantial debt to \\nthe company stemming from the subsidy. Labor unions protested, expressing concerns about transparency and historical \\ncorruption in gove rnment spending. While unpopular, the government's decision was considered economically sensible, \\nnecessitating parallel improvements in areas like power supply and transportation to alleviate citizens' pains (Al Jazeera, \\n2023). \\n5.2 Comparative Analysis with 2012 subsidy removal \\nThe 2023 subsidy removal in Nigeria echoes previous cases, such as the 2012 subsidy protests, revealing both similarities and \\ncontrasts. Comparative analysis sheds light on the underlying economic, political, and social dynamics that dr ive subsidy \\nremoval decisions and their consequences. The present subsidy removal shares parallels with the 2012 case, yet it also exhibits \\ndistinctive features, potentially indicating evolving governance strategies. \\nThe 2023 subsidy removal reflects the N igerian government's continued efforts to address fiscal challenges and rationalize \\nsubsidy expenditure. The move, as seen in the 2012 case, aims to reduce the fiscal burden and redirect funds to developmental \\ninitiatives (Ude, 2023). However, this recent decision differentiates itself by aligning with the manifestos of the major \\npresidential candidates before the 2023 election, indicating political consensus on the necessity of reform (Al Jazeera, 2023 ). \\nThis reflects a more strategic and calculated approach compared to the sudden announcement in 2012. \\nThe response from citizens in both cases underlines their dependence on subsidies and the perceived impact on their economic \\nwell-being. In 2012, widespread protests erupted due to the abruptness of the policy change and its immediate impact on fuel \\nprices (Houeland, 2020). Similarly, the 2023 removal prompted public chaos as individuals rushed to purchase fuel before \\nprices escalated (Al Jazeera, 2023). The reactions highlight the significant role subsidies play in the daily lives of Nigerians. \\nComparing the economic context reveals certain trends. Both cases underscore the financial unsustainability of maintaining \\nsubsidies. The 2012 subsidy removal aimed to address increasing subsidy costs, similar to the 2023 situation where escalating \\ncosts became a primary concern (Ude, 2023). The 2012 protests emphasized the need for fiscal transparency, and the present \\ndecision was driven by the administration's acknowledgment of the subsidy's adverse economic effects (A l Jazeera, 2023). \\nThese parallels indicate the recurring financial strain subsidies impose on Nigeria's economy. \\nPolitical factors are also evident in both cases. In 2012, President Goodluck Jonathan's subsidy removal decision led to public \\noutcry and labour unions' protests, forcing a partial reversal (Houeland, 2020). In contrast, the 2023 subsidy removal was \\nannounced by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, showing his administration's commitment to addressing economic challenges \\nand avoiding similar public backlash. This suggests that the current government may have learned from past experiences and \\nadopted a more calculated approach. \\nSocial impact remains a central concern. The 2012 protests highlighted the subsidy's importance as a social safety net, \\nespecially for the vulnerable population (Houeland, 2020). Similarly, the 2023 decision raised concerns about exacerbating  \\ninequality, given that a significant portion of the population lives in multidimensional poverty. This continuity underscores  \\nthe necessity of considering the impact on the most vulnerable segments of society. \\n \\n6 Economic Implications \\n6.1 Government Budget and Fiscal Dynamics \\nThe removal of subsidies has been a subject of considerable debate due to its potential economic implications, particularly \\nconcerning government budgets and fiscal dynamics. In Nigeria, this has been a salient issue, as highlighted in recent research. \\nAkinyemi et al. (2017) conducted a simulation study using a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) approach to \\nanalyse the impact of fuel subsidy removal on the agricultural sector. Their findings revealed that subsidy removal could have \\nfar-reaching effects on various sectors, with repercussions for government revenue and expenditure patterns. This study \\nemphasizes the importance of understanding the intricate interplay between subsidy removal, sectoral performance, and fiscal \\ndynamics. \\nThe economic implications of subsidy removal for government budgets and fiscal dynamics are multifaceted. On the one hand, \\nsubsidy removal could lead to increased government revenue if the savings from subsidy elimination are allocated efficiently. \\nHowever, this revenue gain must be balanced against potential social and economic consequences, particularly for  the \\nvulnerable population. Additionally, the government's ability to effectively manage and allocate these newfound resources is \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './data/Evansetal.2023SubsidyRemoval.pdf', 'page': 8, 'page_label': '9'}, page_content=\"BIZECONS QUARTERLY 19 \\n \\n \\ncrucial in determining the overall fiscal impact. The studies mentioned provide insights into the intricate interactions between \\nsubsidy removal, fiscal dynamics, and sectoral performance, urging policymakers to adopt a holistic approach that considers \\nboth short-term fiscal gains and long-term economic stability. \\n6.2 Inflation and Consumer Price Changes \\nThe removal of petroleum subsidies has stirred significant debate due to its potential economic implications, particularly its \\nimpact on inflation and consumer prices. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the rate of change in prices of \\ngoods and services, is a crucial indicator to assess the inflationary pressures resulting from such policy changes. According  to \\nthe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Nigeria's CPI surged to 22.41 percent in May 2023, marking the fifth consecutive rise \\nin the country's inflation rate this year (NBS, 2023). The correlation between subsidy removal and inflation has been explored \\nin various studies. Okwanya et al. (2015) conducted an assessment of the impact of petroleum subsidies on the consumer price \\nindex in Nigeria. Their findings suggested that the removal of subsidies tends to exert upward pressure on the CPI, leading t o \\ninflationary trends.  \\nOkwanya et al. (2015) findings resonate with the recent data indicating a 0.19 percentage point increase in the inflation rate \\nfollowing the subsidy removal ( see NBS, 2023). The subsidy removal increased the PMS price across the country from an \\naverage of ₦238.11 at the end of May 2023 to ₦545.83 at the end of June 2023 (see Figure 1). This significant price rise came \\nwith its associated influence on the total inflation and food inflation rate, as shown in Fig. 2. The evidence indicates that  the \\ninflation rate before the subsidy r emoval was 22.41%. After the removal, it rose slightly to 22.79% in June; in July, it rose by \\nnearly 2% to 24.08%. On the other hand, the food inflation rate of 24.82% in May rose to 25.25% and 26.98% at the end of \\nJune and July, respectively. Since severa l small and medium enterprises (SMEs) rely on the PMS, local input prices rise due. \\nAs such, final consumers are at the receiving end through higher food prices leading to a surge in inflation. Also, since the PMS \\nis a fundamental transportation component,  the overall transportation cost rises, raising the cost of delivering goods across \\nthe supply chain. \\nFigure 1. Inflation (May to July 2023) \\n \\nData Source: Central Bank of Nigeria (2023) \\nA comparative perspective can be drawn from the work of Husaini et al. (2019) in Malaysia, where energy subsidies and oil \\nprice fluctuations were analysed. Although the context is different, the study highlighted that subsidy removal can interact with \\noil price dynamics to influence consumer price behaviour. Similar dynamics might be at play in Nigeria, where the removal of \\npetroleum subsidies can magnify the impact of oil price changes on domestic consumer prices. Babalola and Salau (2020) also \\nconducted a panel dynamic analysis focused on petroleum pump prices and the consumer price index in Nigeria. Their study \\nemphasized the complexity of the relationship, revealing that while subsidy removal might contribute to inflation, other \\nfactors, such as exchange  rate fluctuations, economic structure, and government fiscal policies, can also exert influence. \\nTherefore, it is crucial to consider a holistic framework when evaluating the consequences of subsidy removal. \\nThe recent NBS report points out that the food inflation rate in May 2023 stood at 24.82 percent on a year -on-year basis, \\ndriven by increases in prices of essential commodities like oil and fat, yam, bread, cereals, fish, and meat (NBS, 2023). Thi s \\nunderscores the cascading effects of subsidy removal o n various sectors of the economy, potentially exacerbating inflationary \\npressures. The analysis of month-on-month and year-on-year data highlights the upward trajectory of inflation in the wake of \\nsubsidy removal. Year-on-year inflation in May 2023 was 4.7 0 percentage points higher compared to May 2022, and month -\\non-month inflation in May 2023 was 0.03 percent higher than in April 2023 (NBS, 2023). This trend indicates that the subsidy \\nremoval has contributed to persistent inflationary pressures.  \\n22.41 22.79 24.0824.82 25.25 26.98\\n0\\n5\\n10\\n15\\n20\\n25\\n30\\nMay June July\\nPERCENTAGE (%)\\nMonths\\n Total Inflation Rate\\n Food Inflation Rate\"),\n",

Additionally, subsidies lower and stabilize fuel prices, thus contributing to price stability in the economy. Moreo ver, \\nfuel subsidies support various industries by keeping input costs, particularly transportation, relatively lower, which sustains  \\neconomic activities (NES Group, 2023). Market distortions and inefficiencies arise from the deviation of prices from market \\nclearing prices, which can lead to shortages and disruptions in the supply chain. As Nigeria grapples with the economic \\nimplications of subsidy removal, policymakers therefore need to adopt a comprehensive approach that considers not only \\nshort-term inflationary effects but also broader economic dynamics and potential mitigative measures. \\n6.3 Foreign Exchange and Trade Balance \\nThe removal of subsidies, particularly in the petroleum sector, has significant economic implications for Nigeria, particular ly \\nin terms of its i mpact on foreign exchange reserves and the trade balance. The removal of fuel subsidies can have direct \\nconsequences on the availability of foreign exchange due to its connection with crude oil imports and its potential influence on \\nthe trade balance. Research by Adagunodo (2022) highlights the effect of oil receipts and fuel subsidy payments on the current \\naccount deficit in Nigeria, shedding light on the complex relationship between subsidies and the external balance. Similarly,  \\nthe work of Akinyemi et al. (2017) employed a dynamic Computable General Equilibrium Approach to simulate the removal of \\nfuel subsidies and its impact on the agricultural sector, demonstrating the interconnectedness of various economic sectors in  \\nresponse to subsidy removal. \\nNigeria, renowned for its considerable oil production, paradoxically grapples with  significant inadequate domestic refining \\nfacilities, necessitating a reliance on imported refined petroleum products. This intricate juxtaposition underscores a centr al \\neconomic dilemma – the need to allocate foreign exchange earnings and revenue to fund these vital imports. The fuel subsidy, \\nby artificially suppressing the costs of imports, constitutes a substantial financial commitment, diverting foreign exchange \\nresources that could otherwise be directed towards other pivotal developmental avenues. Therefore, subsidizing fuel imports \\ndiverts foreign exchange earnings and revenue that could be used for other developmental purposes, negatively impacting the \\ncountry's trade balance (NES Group, 2023). \\nAt its core, this foreign exchange diversion, though meant to cushion the impact of fuel price fluctuations, essentially shifts the \\nbalance of foreign exchange earnings. Instead of leveraging these earnings for diverse developmental init iatives, a significant \\nportion is channelled into fuel subsidies. This not only perpetuates Nigeria's dependency on imported refined products but \\nalso contributes to a skewed trade balance scenario. In practical terms, the subsidy setup requires the Nigerian government to \\nallocate foreign exchange resources for fuel imports that would otherwise be available for other crucial imports or investments. \\nThis redirection strains the trade balance, influencing the dynamics of exports and imports. The distortion in foreign exchange \\nallocation inadvertently skews the nation's trade equilibrium, potentially affecting the overall stability of its economy. This can \\nexplain the government’s complementary policy decision not to fund foreign exchange demands of importers and the merger \\nof the erstwhile dual exchange rate regimes. \\n \\n7 Social Consequences  \\n7.1 Impact on Vulnerable Populations \\nThe removal of subsidies  carries profound social consequences, particularly for  the vulnerable population. Research by \\nRentschler (2016) highlights the regional variation of poverty effects due to fossil fuel subsidy reform, underscoring how such \\nreforms can disproportionately impact certain regions and communities. Mmadu and Akan (2013)  have also examined the \\nimplications of inefficient subsidies in Nigeria's oil sector on household welfare, providing valuable insights into the \\nintersection of subsidies and vulnerable populations. Ovaga and Okechukwu (2012) have delved into the downstream oil sector \\nand its impact on the masses, offering further understanding of subsidy-related consequences. \\nThe recent data reveals that Nigeria's inflation rate has led to a significant increase in poverty levels, with an estimated four \\nmillion people falling into poverty between January and May 2023. Moreover, the removal of fuel subsidies has exacerbated \\nthe situation, with about 7.1 million poor Nigerians at risk of becoming even poorer if the government does not provide \\ncompensation or palliatives (Worl d Bank, 2023).  These developments echo the findings of Rentschler (2016), showing how \\nsubsidy reforms can lead to varying regional impacts on poverty levels. In the case of Nigeria, the removal of fuel subsidies has \\nled to an increase in prices, particularly affecting poor and economically insecure households. As petrol prices have now tripled \\nfollowing the subsidy removal, these vulnerable households, who directly or indirectly rely on petrol consumption, are \\nadversely affected. \\nThe immediate consequence of this price increase is an equivalent income loss of ₦5,700 per month for poor and economically \\ninsecure households. Without compensation, an additional 7.1 million people could be pushed into poverty, exacerbating an \\nalready di re situation (World Bank, 2023). This aligns with the findings of Mmadu and Akan (2013), who explored how \\ninefficient subsidies in the oil sector can impact household welfare.  Furthermore, the removal of subsidies can lead to \\nconsequential coping mechanisms among newly poor and economically insecure households. These mechanisms may include \\ncutting back on essential services such as education and healthcare, or compromising on nutritional choices (World Bank, \\n2023). To mitigate these adverse effects on vulne rable populations, the World Bank emphasizes the need for adequate \\ncompensation and transfer mechanisms. Such compensating transfers can shield households from the initial price impacts of \\nsubsidy reform and provide essential support to those at risk of falling deeper into poverty. \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './data/Evansetal.2023SubsidyRemoval.pdf', 'page': 10, 'page_label': '11'}, page_content='BIZECONS QUARTERLY 21 \\n \\n \\n7.2 Public Perception and Political Support \\nWhile there are various perspectives on the subsidy removal, it is evident that the public perception and political support f or \\nthis policy change are crucial factors in shaping its success  and impact on the Nigerian society.  The political climate \\nsurrounding the subsidy removal is marked by both consensus and confusion. Key presidential candidates expressed \\ncommitments to removing fuel subsidies, albeit with varying nuances in their approaches. However, the lack of a clear plan on \\nhow the removal aligns with strategic economic objectives raises concerns. The diverse economic challenges Nigeria faces, \\nincluding its lowest minimum wage in the world, high levels of poverty, and significant unem ployment (Amadi, 2023), \\nunderscore the need for a comprehensive approach that considers the potential social consequences of the subsidy removal. \\nPublic perception of subsidy removal is multifaceted and often divided along the lines of equity and efficienc y. The efficiency \\ncamp advocates for the removal to address fiscal challenges and reduce inefficient resource allocation. Supporters of this \\nviewpoint argue that market efficiency can be achieved through proper pricing, reducing the public sector\\'s fiscal burden and \\nencouraging effective use of resources. However, the equity-focused camp emphasizes the broader social impact, especially on \\nvulnerable and marginalized populations. The abrupt and complete removal of subsidies may exacerbate poverty and \\ninequality (Amadi, 2023). \\nThe dynamics between efficiency and equity intersects with the Nigerian government\\'s roles of allocation, distribution, and \\nstabilization in public finance. While the government\\'s focus on efficiency is crucial for fiscal stability and resource allocation, \\nthe distributive role necessitates addressing the wellbeing of citizens. The abrupt removal of subsidies without effective \\ncompensatory measures risks disproportionately affecting the poorest and most vulnerable segments of society . In addition, \\nthe debate around subsidy removal highlights the larger issue of inequality within the Nigerian political economy. The country\\'s \\nhigh Gini coefficient and lack of robust social protection mechanisms contribute to a divided society where the impac ts of \\npolicy changes can vary dramatically. The removal of subsidies, if not accompanied by comprehensive economic restructuring, \\ncan deepen inequality and poverty (Amadi, 2023). \\nFurthermore, historical experiences, such as Nigeria\\'s track record of corruption and inefficiency in subsidy administration,  \\ncontribute to public scepticism and mistrust of government actions. Previous instances of policy adjustments and their \\nconsequences on citizens\\' wellbeing impact how the public perceives current policy changes. One crucial factor influencing \\npublic perception is the government\\'s approach to social safety nets and compensatory measures. The promise of cash transfers \\nto poor households , while aiming to mitigate the impacts of subsidy removal, raises questions about its adequacy and \\neffectiveness in addressing the broader socioeconomic challenges. Political leaders\\' responses to the concerns of citizens, \\nparticularly those in the informal sector, are pivotal in shaping public sentiment and trust in the government\\'s intentions. \\n7.3 Nigerian Youths\\' Response and Involvement \\nThe removal of subsidies carries significant social implications, particularly in terms of how Nigerian youths respond and  get \\ninvolved. Studies like Akor (2017) have illuminated the role of Nigerian youths in social movements and protests, highlighting \\nthe influence of social media as a platform for mobilization. Uzuegbunam (2015) and Uji (2015) also underscore the power of \\nsocial media in shaping young people\\'s engagement in socio -political issues and transformative activities. This existing \\nresearch provides a foundation to examine the social implications of subsidy removal on Nigerian youths. \\nThe inauguration of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu triggered a series of reactions, especially among Nigerian youths, fuelled \\nby social media trends and hashtags. The controversial nature of the election and the subsequent subsidy removal sparked \\nconversations and debates across platforms, underscoring the role of young Nigerians as active participants in shaping public \\ndiscourse. This digital activism and engagement reflect the findings of Uzuegbunam (2015) and Uji (2015), demonstrating the \\npotential for social media to amplify youth voices and mobilize action. \\nThe removal of fuel subsidies brought immediate economic repercussions, with a significant surge in fuel prices and \\nsubsequent effects on transportation costs and food inflation. This sudden increase in living expenses particularly impacts the \\nyouth, a demographic already grappling with employment challenges and limited financial resources. These economic \\npressures can lead to increased frustrations, potentially fuelling social unrest and demonstrations, as seen in past instances \\nlike the fuel subsidy protests of January 2012 (Akor, 2017). Nigerian youths\\' response to the subsidy removal is not limited to \\ndigital activism; it extends to their perspectives on migration. The inclination to \"japa\" (emigrate) to seek greener pasture s \\nreflects the desperation of youths seeking better economic opportunities, often in foreign countries. This trend highlights the \\ndisillusionment caused by domestic economic challenges, including those exacerbated by subsidy removal.  \\n \\n8 Environmental Considerations  \\n8.1 Carbon Emissions and Climate Change Impacts \\nThe decision to eliminate petrol subsidies carries profound implications for the nation\\'s environmental landscape, particularly \\nin the context of carbon emissions and climate change mitigation. This policy ch ange aids the goal of bolstering Nigeria\\'s \\nresponse to climate change by not only reducing fuel consumption but also curtailing the release of carbon emissions into the  \\natmosphere. Preliminary analysis conducted by the National Council on Climate Change reveals a significant positive \\ncorrelation between fuel subsidy removal and environmental benefits. Notably, there has been an approximate 30% reduction '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './data/Evansetal.2023SubsidyRemoval.pdf', 'page': 11, 'page_label': '12'}, page_content=\"22       EVANS ET AL.  \\n \\nin daily fuel consumption, tra nslating to a staggering 20 million litres per day , and this  reduction, in turn, results in a \\nremarkable daily saving of approximately 42,800 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions (Olorunfemi, 2023). \\nThe environmental ramifications of this reduction were elucidated at a workshop organized by the National Council on Climate \\nChange. The decision to remove fuel subsidies, while economically impacting Nigerians, is poised to save over 15 million tonnes \\nof carbon dioxide emissions annually. This translates to a sub stantial 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared \\nto the baseline projection of 45 million metric tonnes of total GHG carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030 and this outcome aligns \\nNigeria with its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) ahead of schedule (Olorunfemi, 2023). \\nWhen projected over a year, these saved emissions offer remarkable implications for Nigeria's environmental trajectory. The \\nreduction of over 15 million tonnes of CO2 presents a remarkable step towards curbing the nation's carbo n footprint and \\nadvancing its climate goals. By aligning with global commitments under the NDC framework, Nigeria's efforts to reduce carbon \\nemissions offer a proactive stance in mitigating climate change and contributing to international climate efforts. \\n8.2 Transition to Renewable Energy \\nThe elimination of fuel subsidies offers a turning point, driving Nigerians towards embracing renewable energy solutions, \\nparticularly solar power. The exorbitant costs of fuel-powered generators make renewable options increasingly appealing. The \\nresulting surge in solar adoption is likely to catalyse rapid growth in the renewable energy sector, offering a more sustainable \\nand cost-effective energy solution. \\nNigeria's power sector is at a critical juncture, demanding comprehen sive improvements to sustain industrial growth. The \\ncountry's enormous potential for renewable energy, including solar and hydro power, presents a transformative solution \\n(Babatunde et al., 2019; Evans, 2023). Harnessing these resources could reshape Nigeria's energy landscape, ensuring access \\nto reliable and affordable electricity for its population. With abundant sunlight and water resources, Nigeria possesses the \\nfoundation to generate electricity through renewable sources. Coupled with its crude oil res erves, gas byproducts could be \\nemployed for power generation, mitigating waste , and enhancing energy efficiency. However, ensuring the viability of these \\nrenewable sources necessitates efficient grid management and balanced consumption. The transition towa rds renewable \\nenergy in China exemplifies how diversified energy portfolios can underpin a stable and service -oriented power industry, \\npromoting both economic growth and sustainable development. \\nDespite the promising potential of renewable energy, various hurdles impede its progress in Nigeria. High installation costs, \\nlack of after -sales services, and variations in product quality hamper widespread adoption. Misconceptions about solar \\nproducts and the perception of short -lived batteries need to be addresse d through education and awareness campaigns. \\nChanging mindsets and highlighting the long-term value of quality solar products are essential in surmounting these obstacles. \\n8.3 Environmental Benefits and Challenges \\nOne of the primary environmental benefits of subsidy removal is the potential reduction in fuel consumption. Subsidies often \\nencourage wasteful energy use, as artificially low prices discourage energy efficiency. With the elimination of subsidies, \\nconsumers are likely to become more mindful of energy consumption, leading to reduced carbon emissions. The associated \\ndecline in fuel consumption can contribute to cleaner air quality and reduced pollution, positively impacting public health and \\nthe environment (Akinyemi et al., 2015; Evans & Mesagan, 2022). A crucial challenge, however, is the potential for increased \\nenergy costs to consumers. As subsidies are lifted, fuel prices rise, which could disproportionately affect vulnerable \\npopulations. The burden of increased energy expenses could be borne by low -income households, potentially exacerbating \\nsocial inequalities. Policymakers need to implement measures to address this challenge, such as targeted support programs \\nfor those most affected by price hikes. \\nA significant environmental benefit of subsidy rem oval is the potential reduction in carbon emissions. The removal of fuel \\nsubsidies can lead to decreased fuel consumption and consequently lower emissions of greenhouse gases. Nigeria's \\ncommitment to the Paris Agreement and its Intended Nationally Determin ed Contributions (INDCs) necessitate substantial \\ncarbon reduction efforts (Akinyemi et al., 2017). The removal of subsidies aligns with these climate goals by incentivizing \\ncleaner energy practices and reducing the carbon footprint. A related challenge is the need for a well-designed transition plan \\nto guide the shift towards cleaner energy sources. While subsidy removal can encourage cleaner energy adoption, it requires a \\ncomprehensive strategy to ensure a smooth transition. Adequate infrastructure, incentives for renewable energy investments, \\nand public awareness campaigns are necessary components to support this shift and avoid potential setbacks.  \\nFurthermore, subsidy removal can promote investment in renewable energy sources. As fossil fuel prices rise due to subsidy \\nelimination, the attractiveness of renewable energy becomes more pronounced. This can lead to increased investments in solar, \\nwind, hydro, and other renewable energy projects, fostering sustainable energy development in Nigeria. However, the  \\nchallenge lies in creating an enabling environment for these investments, including clear regulations, access to financing, and \\nsupportive policies.  Subsidy removal can also stimulate technological advancements that improve energy efficiency and \\nenvironmental performance. As consumers and industries seek to manage increased energy costs, there is a potential for \\ninnovations that enhance energy efficiency and reduce emissions. The challenge here is fostering an environment that \\npromotes research, development, and adoption of these technologies.  \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './data/Evansetal.2023SubsidyRemoval.pdf', 'page': 12, 'page_label': '13'}, page_content=\"BIZECONS QUARTERLY 23 \\n \\n \\n9 Market and Industry Analysis  \\n9.1 Changes in the Nigerian Oil Sector \\nThe removal of fuel subsidies in Nigeria has significant implications for the country's oil sector, impacting various facets of the \\nindustry from production to consumption. One of the key impacts of subsidy removal is the alteration of price dynamics within \\nthe Nigerian oil sector. The removal leads to an immediate increase in fuel prices, impacting both retail and industrial \\nconsumers (Majekodunmi, 2013). This change can influence consumer behaviour, potentially leading to reduced demand for \\npetroleum products. As prices rise, consumers may seek alternatives, such as adopting more fuel-efficient vehicles or exploring \\nalternative energy sources. These shi fts in consumption patterns can impact the overall demand for crude oil, affecting the \\nupstream sector. \\nThe upstream oil industry is directly affected by changes in demand for petroleum products. As demand adjusts due to subsidy \\nremoval, oil companies may need to recalibrate their production levels. Reduced demand for refined products could lead to a \\ndecrease in refining activities, affecting the utilization of refineries. Conversely, increased demand for alternative fuels or \\nenergy sources could influence exploration and production decisions as companies navigate evolving market dynamics. \\nMoreover, subsidy removal can stimulate discussions around refining capacity and the potential for domestic refining to meet \\nnational fuel needs. The inability of Nigeria's refineries to operate at full capacity has historically led to substantial fuel imports \\n(Lawal, 2014). However, subsidy removal may encourage private investment in refining infrastructure, aiming to capitalize on \\nthe market's changing landscape. Companies could see potential profitability in local refining if the cost economics of importing \\nrefined products become less favourable due to increased fuel prices. \\nMarket dynamics are also influenced by global oil price trends. Changes in international oil prices can be compounded by \\ndomestic factors such as subsidy removal (Husaini et al., 2019). If subsidy removal coincides with periods of volatile oil prices, \\nthe combined impact could amplify market uncertainties. Oil companies, both domestic and international, will need to navigate \\nthese complexities and make strategic decisions regarding investment, exploration, and production. \\nWhile subsidy removal introduces certain challenges, it can also create opportunities for diversification and innovation in t he \\nNigerian oil sector. With consumers seeking alternatives to cope with higher fuel prices,  there may be increased interest in \\nrenewable energy sources, biofuels, and energy -efficient technologies. This could open doors for new players to enter the \\nmarket, fostering innovation and competition. The Nigerian government's role in shaping the oil sector becomes crucial during \\nsubsidy removal. Policymakers must ensure a conducive regulatory environment that encourages investment and competition \\nwhile safeguarding the interests of consumers. Regulatory clarity and transparent pricing mechanisms are par amount to \\nmaintaining investor confidence in the sector (Lawal, 2014). \\n9.2 Domestic Refining Capacity and Self-Sufficiency \\nThe removal of fuel subsidies in Nigeria has substantial implications for the country's domestic refining capacity and its \\naspirations for self-sufficiency in the petroleum sector. Historically, Nigeria's domestic refining capacity has been insufficient \\nto meet the nation's fuel demands, resulting in substantial imports (Iheukwumere et al., 2020). The subsidy removal creates \\nboth challenges  and opportunities for the development of domestic refining capacity. On one hand, the increased cost of \\nimported fuel could incentivize investments in refining infrastructure to mitigate import dependence. On the other hand, the \\npotential increase in fuel  prices post-subsidy removal could amplify the profitability of refining activities, encouraging both \\npublic and private sector participation in refining projects. \\nThe country's aspirations for self -sufficiency in the petroleum sector align with the goal o f increasing domestic refining \\ncapacity. The Nigerian government has expressed its desire to reduce the need for fuel imports and achieve self -sufficiency in \\nrefining (Temitayo, 2014). Subsidy removal could serve as a catalyst for accelerating progress tow ards this goal by reshaping \\nmarket dynamics and creating a more favourable economic environment for investments in refining. However, the challenges \\nof establishing and maintaining refining infrastructure in Nigeria remain significant. Past attempts at ref inery construction \\nhave faced delays, cost overruns, and technical challenges (Iheukwumere et al., 2020). The regulatory environment, policy \\nconsistency, and infrastructure development are critical factors that impact the feasibility of refining projects. Market \\ndynamics also play a role in influencing refining decisions. The global crude oil price environment, supply-demand imbalances, \\nand fluctuations in international oil prices can impact the economics of refining operations (Akinrele, 2016). The Nigeria n \\ngovernment must consider these external factors when formulating strategies to enhance domestic refining capacity. \\nThe removal of subsidies could encourage a shift from an import -oriented approach to one focused on domestic production. \\nBy increasing the cost of imported fuel, the economic equation for domestic refining becomes more favourable. This could \\npotentially lead to increased utilization of existing refineries, revitalization of dormant ones, and the construction of new  \\nfacilities. To capitalize on these opportunities, Nigeria must address various challenges, including regulatory hurdles, \\ninfrastructure deficiencies, and policy inconsistencies. Additionally, the government should explore partnerships with \\nexperienced international refin ing companies to leverage their technical expertise and investment capabilities (Temitayo, \\n2014). \\n9.3 Private Sector Participation and Investment Trends \\nThe removal of fuel subsidies has substantial implications for private sector participation and investment trends in the \\ncountry's petroleum industry. Fuel subsidy removal signals a shift towards a more market -oriented approach in Nigeria's \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './data/Evansetal.2023SubsidyRemoval.pdf', 'page': 13, 'page_label': '14'}, page_content='24       EVANS ET AL.  \\n \\npetroleum sector, creating opportunities for increased private sector participation. The Nigerian government\\'s decision to  \\nderegulate the downstream sector is aimed at attracting private investment and enhancing competition (Olujobi et al., 2020). \\nThe removal of subsidies can catalyse this process by removing price distortions and creating a more conducive environment \\nfor private sector involvement. \\nPrivate sector participation can lead to enhanced efficiency, increased investment, and improved infrastructure. The incentive \\nfor private investors lies in the potential for higher returns on investment in a deregulated market. As  subsidies are phased \\nout, the market becomes more attractive for private players, encouraging them to invest in refining, distribution, and other \\ndownstream activities (Itsekor, 2020).  Investment trends are likely to shift towards areas that were previous ly less \\neconomically viable due to subsidy distortions. The removal of subsidies could encourage investments in refining \\ninfrastructure, as the economics of domestic refining become more favourable without price distortions. Furthermore, private \\ninvestment could flow into alternative energy sources and technologies, as the market responds to the new price dynamics. \\nHowever, challenges remain in attracting significant private investment. Regulatory uncertainties, inconsistent policies, and  \\npolitical factors have historically hindered private sector participation in Nigeria\\'s petroleum industry (Onyishi et al., 2012). \\nTo harness the potential of subsidy removal, the government needs to provide a stable regulatory framework that fosters \\ninvestor confidence. Tra nsparent and predictable policies will encourage private sector engagement and long -term \\ninvestments. \\nThe impact of subsidy removal on investment trends is interconnected with global oil price dynamics. Investors\\' decisions are \\ninfluenced by international oil prices, which impact the profitability of petroleum -related activities. A comprehensive \\nunderstanding of global oil market trends is crucial for both the government and private investors to make informed decisions \\n(Joseph et al., 2019). As Nigeria aims to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) to boost its petroleum industry, subsidy removal \\ncould be a catalyst for increased FDI inflows. A more competitive and transparent market can attract international investors \\nwho seek stable and profitable investm ent opportunities. To fully capitalize on this potential, Nigeria must create an \\nenvironment that welcomes and supports foreign investment. \\n \\n10 Mitigation Strategies and Compensation \\n10.1 Government Compensation Programmes \\nCurrently, fuel subsidies consume a signi ficant portion of the recurrent budget, diverting resources that could be better \\nallocated to pro-poor initiatives. The reluctance to reform this system can be attributed to concerns about political backlash, \\ncorruption, and pressure from beneficiaries of the subsidy. However, a growing consensus acknowledges the necessity of \\nreform, particularly the removal of fuel subsidies. Adeoti et al. (2016) examine compensation mechanisms that could offset the \\nadverse effects of fuel subsidy removal on vulnerable segments of Nigerian society. Notably, recent policy changes, such as the \\n\"price modulation\" policy introduced by the Buhari government, have led to  adjustments in fuel prices, underscoring the \\nongoing relevance of Adeoti et al. (2016). \\nResearch conducted by Majekodunmi (2013) highlights that fuel subsidies have accounted for over a third of Nigeria\\'s \\nrecurrent budget, representing a substantial misal location of resources that could otherwise be directed towards pro -poor \\ninitiatives. McCulloch et al. (2021) emphasize the need for subsidy reform to uphold the social contract and promote economic \\nefficiency. Additionally, Lawal (2014) underscores that th e removal of subsidies is essential for the growth of Nigeria\\'s \\npetroleum industry. \\nCompensation mechanisms proposed in Adeoti et al. (2016) include a diverse range of strategies to mitigate the impact of \\nsubsidy removal. These strategies are rooted in emp irical evidence and international experiences. Siddig et al. (2014) explore \\nthe impacts of fuel import subsidy removal on poverty and demonstrate the importance of well -designed compensation \\nmechanisms. The suggested measures include transport vouchers, ma ss transit schemes, E -Wallets for smallholder farmers, \\nfree school meals, free healthcare for vulnerable populations, cash transfer schemes, and vocational skills development \\nprograms. \\nAdeoti et al. (2016) recommends that these compensation measures should  be implemented without any form of bias or \\ndiscrimination. The creation of new institutions is deemed unnecessary; rather, existing ministries and agencies should be \\nrepositioned and empowered to manage the compensation programs  (Evans, 2022). The establi shment of a Directorate for \\nSubsidy Reinvestment Monitoring (DSRM) under the National Planning Commission (NPC) is proposed, ensuring effective \\noversight and management of compensation funds. This aligns with Ikenga and Oluka\\'s (2023) suggestion that an or ganized \\napproach is crucial for subsidy removal\\'s benefits to materialize. \\nAdeoti et al. (2016) estimates that the proposed compensation programs could be initiated with a budget of up to ₦250 billion \\n(USD 1.2 billion) and anticipates a reduction in costs over subsequent years. This financial insight is consistent with the \\neconomic considerations raised by Amakom (2013) in the context of the Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme \\n(SURE-P). '),\n",

As indicated by Ye mtsov and Moubarak (2018), the readiness of social safety nets is crucial for effectively mitigating \\nthe impacts of such reforms. In line with this, it is essential to explore a combination of strategies that not only minimize  the \\nburden on the poor but also facilitate a gradual transition to subsidy removal. \\nEkong and Akpan (2014) acknowledge the need for energy subsidy reform in Nigeria to foster sustainable development. The \\ndata shows that substantial funds were allocated to fuel subsidies, which could h ave been redirected to sectors like education \\nand healthcare. The proposal to gradually phase out the subsidy over a span of 6 months to 1 year reflects a prudent approach \\nto reduce the immediate shock on vulnerable groups. A key proposal is the subsidization of public transport during the subsidy \\nremoval phase. This is informed by the observation that many countries subsidize public transportation to assist low -income \\nindividuals. Leveraging partnerships with transport interest groups such as the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) and National \\nUnion of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) is a strategic move to ensure the effectiveness of such a scheme. \\nThe importance of increasing the minimum wage to alleviate the impact of subsidy removal is emphasized, echoing the  \\nsentiment of Akinola (2018). Raising the minimum wage would help individuals, especially those at the lower end of the income \\nspectrum, better cope with increased transportation costs resulting from subsidy removal. The proposal to revisit remuneration \\nstructures by employers underscores the collaborative efforts required from both the public and private sectors to protect \\nvulnerable workers. \\nA significant mitigation strategy proposed involves accelerating the adoption of compressed natural gas (CNG) as an alternative \\nfuel. This aligns with global trends towards cleaner and more affordable energy sources. The specific steps outlined, such as  \\nenacting legal frameworks, subsidizing conversion costs, and facilitating CNG availability at filling stations, highl ight a \\ncomprehensive approach to promoting this transition. \\n10.3 Long-Term Economic and Social Sustainability \\nThe removal of fuel subsidies is a complex and multi -faceted issue with significant implications for the nation's long -term \\neconomic and social sustain ability. Historically, fuel subsidies have strained national budgets, resulted in resource \\nmisallocation, and posed challenges to environmental sustainability. As highlighted by Onyishi, Eme, and Emeh (2012), the \\ndomestic and international implications of fuel subsidy removal are profound and require careful consideration. The proposed \\nmitigation strategies and compensation mechanisms point towards a comprehensive approach to address the challenges \\nassociated with subsidy removal. The integration of these s trategies can foster a more sustainable and resilient future for \\nNigeria's economy and society. \\nThe proposed emphasis on targeted social safety nets acknowledges the vulnerability of specific groups, such as low -income \\nfamilies, in the face of subsidy remo val. Rentschler and Bazilian (2017) emphasize the importance of well -designed \\ncompensation mechanisms in achieving effective subsidy reforms. By redirecting funds from subsidies to sectors like \\neducation, healthcare, and infrastructure development, the gov ernment can contribute to long -term economic growth and \\nimprove overall living standards.  Investments in infrastructure development, particularly in sectors like transportation and \\nenergy, hold the potential to stimulate economic growth and create job opportunities. Improving public transportation systems \\nand promoting alternative energy sources aligns with global trends and can mitigate the impact of subsidy removal on \\ntransportation costs. \\nThe historical context of Nigeria's subsidy removal efforts underscores the intricacies of the issue. The various policy changes \\nand controversies highlight the sensitivity of fuel subsidies and the need for informed decision -making. The gradual phasing \\nout of subsidies, as proposed, can help ease the immediate sho cks and provide time for individuals and industries to adjust.  \\nThe focus on fiscal transparency and accountability is crucial to ensure that the savings from subsidy removal are allocated \\nefficiently and effectively. By establishing reliable monitoring systems and conducting routine audits, the government can build \\ntrust among citizens and ensure the proper utilization of resources. \\nPublic communication and education are vital components of successful subsidy reform. The government's commitment to \\nexplaining the rationale behind subsidy removal and the long-term benefits can help manage public expectations and mitigate \\npotential unrest. Effective communication serves to clarify the objectives of subsidy reform. Governments can explain that \\nsubsidies are ofte n unsustainable in the long run, leading to economic inefficiencies, fiscal burdens, and the diversion of \\nresources from more pressing needs like education, healthcare, and infrastructure. This can help citizens grasp the trade -offs \\ninvolved in maintaining  subsidies and the potential benefits of their removal. Moreover, clear communication can dispel \\nmisconceptions and rumours that might circulate in the absence of accurate information  (Adeola & Evans, 2023) . \\nMisunderstandings can lead to public frustration and unrest, which can undermine the reform process. By providing accurate \\nand accessible information, the government can counter misinformation and build trust among the population. \\nIndividual citizens also play a role in navigating the challenges posed b y subsidy removal. Budgeting, financial planning, \\nexploring alternative transportation methods, and adopting energy -efficient practices are essential coping strategies to \\nmitigate the impact of higher fuel costs.  These coping strategies are not only benefi cial at the individual level but also \\ncollectively contribute to the success of subsidy removal on a national scale. If a significant portion of the population ado pts \\nbudgeting, alternative transportation methods, and energy -efficient practices, it can hel p reduce the overall demand for fuel \"),\n",

This, in turn, aligns with the government's objectives of promoting fiscal sustainability and \\nreducing the reliance on subsidies. \\n \\n11 Discussion and Interpretation \\nAs highlighted earlier, Rational Choice Theory, Public Choice Theory, Theory of Social Conflict and the Theory of Ecological \\nModernization provide valuable frameworks for understanding the multifaceted implications of fuel subsidy removal in \\nNigeria. These theories shed light on the economic, political, and environmental dimensions of this complex policy decision. \\nRational Choice Theory posits that individuals make decisions based on rational calculations aimed at maximizing their self -\\ninterest. Applied to subsidy removal, this theory explains the government's motivation to eliminate subsidies due to their \\nunsustainable fiscal burden. The escalating subsidy payments, as evidenced by the increasing yearly figures, indicate a rational \\nresponse to mitigate economic strain. The decision aligns with the government's self-interest in achieving fiscal sustainability, \\naddressing long -term budgetary concerns, and attracting investment by creating a favourable economic environment. \\nAdditionally, this theory underscores citizens' rational behaviour in coping with higher fuel costs. As fuel prices rise post -\\nsubsidy removal, individuals are likely to adapt their transportation choices and energy consumption patterns to minimize \\npersonal financial impact, aligning with the theory's assumptions. \\nPublic Choice Theory extends rational choice concepts to the realm of public decision-making and government actions. In the \\ncontext of subsidy removal, this theory highlights the interplay of political dynamics and rational decision -making by \\npolicymakers. The rise in subsidy payments over the years, driven by political considerations, reflects the public choice \\nframework's focus on government decisions influenced by various interest groups and political incentives. Moreover, the \\ntheory emphasizes the need for efficient resource allocation and minimizing wasteful government spending, aligning with the \\nrationale for subsidy removal to reallocate funds for developmental purposes. The theory also underscores the importance of \\npublic communication and education, as governments strive to manage public expectations and explain the rationale behind \\nsubsidy removal, addressing potential backlash and preserving public trust. \\nThe Theory of Social Conflict posits that when policies or actions threaten the interests, res ources, or well-being of different \\nsocietal groups, conflict can arise as these groups compete to protect their interests. This can lead to tensions, clashes, a nd \\nstruggles for power and resources within society. Subsidy removal can have varying impacts on  different segments of society. \\nSome groups might benefit from reduced government spending or increased revenue, while others could be disproportionately \\naffected by higher costs for essential goods or services. This can create a situation where various societal groups have conflicting \\ninterests and potentially lead to social tensions. The Theory of Social Conflict provides a framework to analyze the clashes and \\ntensions that can emerge when subsidy removal disproportionately affects certain groups. For exa mple, low -income \\nindividuals who rely heavily on subsidized goods might be adversely affected by removal, leading to protests and social unrest. \\nAt the same time, other groups might support the removal for its potential economic benefits. The theory unders cores the \\nimportance of not only assessing the economic implications of policies like subsidy removal but also understanding their \\nbroader social and distributional effects. These effects can include changes in income distribution, access to essential services, \\nand overall quality of life. \\nThe Theory of Ecological Modernization provides insights into the environmental dimension of subsidy removal. This theory \\nposits that societies can transition to more sustainable practices by integrating environmental con cerns into economic \\ndevelopment strategies. In the Nigerian context, the removal of fuel subsidies aligns with the theory's principles by encouraging \\na shift away from fossil fuel dependency. The decision reflects an understanding of the environmental cost s associated with \\nsubsidies, including carbon emissions and resource depletion. The potential acceleration of the renewable energy sector, \\nparticularly solar power, echoes the theory's emphasis on adopting environmentally friendly practices. The interconnectedness \\nof the oil sector with global dynamics also aligns with the theory's recognition of the need for international cooperation to  \\naddress environmental challenges. \\nThe collective application of these theories enriches the discussion and interpretation  of subsidy removal in Nigeria. Rational \\nChoice Theory and Public Choice Theory elucidate the motivations behind government decisions and citizens' responses, \\nrespectively; the Theory of Social Conflict emphasizes the importance of considering both economic and social factors when \\ncrafting policy solutions, ultimately striving for outcomes that are fair and acceptable to the diverse groups within society ; \\nwhile the Theory of Ecological Modernization underscores the potential for environmentally susta inable outcomes. These \\ntheories collectively underscore the complexity of subsidy removal as a multi-dimensional policy issue that requires a balanced \\nconsideration of economic, political, and environmental factors. \\nThe emerging patterns and trends from th ese findings provide a comprehensive overview of the multifaceted implications of \\nsubsidy removal in Nigeria. These patterns emphasize the intricate relationships between economic, social, and environmental \\ndimensions, requiring a holistic approach for eff ective policymaking and sustainable development.  Firstly, the \\ninterconnectedness of economic aspects becomes apparent as the removal of subsidies reverberates across various sectors and \\ngovernment budgets. The study underscores the need for policymakers to  possess a deep understanding of revenue streams, \\ndistribution patterns, and fiscal dynamics. A comprehensive approach that considers both immediate fiscal outcomes and \\nbroader socio-economic effects is crucial for ensuring sustainable and equitable economic growth. \"),\n",

Adequate compensation and support mechanisms are imperative to mit igate these adverse effects and \\nensure equitable economic changes. The multi-dimensional social impact on Nigerian youth is another key trend. Their diverse \\nresponses, from digital activism to migration aspirations, underline their dynamic role in shaping societal narratives. \\nRecognizing these consequences is essential for policymakers to ensure the meaningful inclusion of youth in socio -economic \\nand political development. \\nAdditionally, the political dynamics underlying subsidy removal reveal a complex inte rplay of economic imperatives, \\ngovernance challenges, and public sentiment. The lack of preparedness for immediate aftermath can lead to fuel scarcity, price \\nhikes, and economic challenges.

The intricate interplay of economic, social, and environmental dimensions \\nresulting from subsidy removal carries far -reaching consequences that policymakers must address for a sustainable and \\nequitable future. \\nEconomically, the findings e mphasize the need for careful fiscal management and comprehensive understanding of revenue \\nstreams and distribution patterns. The removal of subsidies impacts government budgets and fiscal dynamics, necessitating \\nprudent resource allocation to ensure susta inable economic growth. Policymakers should consider both immediate fiscal \\noutcomes and long-term socio-economic effects when formulating strategies, thereby minimizing potential negative impacts \\non vulnerable populations. \\nThe research findings also signal  the importance of addressing inflation and consumer price indices. While subsidy removal \\nmight initially lead to price hikes, policymakers should adopt comprehensive approaches that not only mitigate short -term \\ninflation but also address broader economic dynamics. Effective inflation management strategies, coupled with policies to \\nprotect vulnerable segments of society, will contribute to a more stable socio-economic environment. \\nFurthermore, the implications underscore the need to foster a diversified eco nomy beyond oil. The removal of subsidies \\nhighlights opportunities for industry diversification and innovation within the oil sector and beyond. Policymakers should \\npromote investments in renewable energy, technology, and other sectors, leading to long -term job creation and economic \\nresilience. \\nSocietally, the findings emphasize the pivotal role of Nigerian youth in shaping the nation's narrative. Recognizing and \\naddressing their responses, aspirations, and concerns is crucial for ensuring social stability and meaningful inclusion in socio-\\neconomic and political development (Akinola & Evans, 2023). Policies that empower and engage the youth in decision-making \\nprocesses can contribute to a more vibrant and dynamic society. \\nThe findings  of this study  underscore the necessity of adequate compensation and support mechanisms for vulnerable \\npopulations. As subsidy removal might exacerbate poverty levels and impact household welfare, well -designed social welfare \\nprograms can help mitigate these adverse effects and f oster inclusive economic growth. This approach will play a pivotal role \\nin addressing income inequality and promoting social cohesion. \\nFrom an environmental perspective, the removal of fuel subsidies opens doors to environmental benefits through reduced \\ncarbon emissions. Policymakers can leverage this opportunity to strengthen Nigeria's commitment to climate change \\nmitigation and achieve national climate targets. Embracing renewable energy options, such as solar power, can further position \\nNigeria as a leader in sustainable development within the region. \\nTo ensure a positive socio-economic future, the research findings highlight the importance of effective governance and strategic \\nplanning. Policymakers need to be prepared for the immediate aftermath of subsidy removal, ensuring stability in fuel supply, \\npricing, and economic measures. Transparent communication and strategic measures, such as leadership enhancement, \\ntransportation improvements, security enhancement, and refinery privatization, will help mitigate potential negative impacts \\nand contribute to a stable economic trajectory. \\n12.3 Social Welfare Programs and Compensatory Measures \\nThe removal of subsidies can trigger significant social consequences that necessitate well -designed social welfare programs \\nand compensatory measures. Schaffitzel et al. (2020) emphasize the role of government transfers in making energy subsidy \\nreform socially acceptable, which provides valuable insights into how compensatory measures can mitigate adverse effects. \\nRentschler and Bazilian (2017) contribute to the discussion by presenting principles for designing effective fossil fuel subsidy \\nreforms, highlighting the importance of a well-structured reform approach.  \\nThe recent back -and-forth policy shifts regarding the subsidy remov al underscore the complexity of this issue in Nigeria. A \\ntransformative approach is needed to align Nigeria's energy policy with global best practices. Examining success stories from  \\nother nations can offer a roadmap for Nigeria's policymakers in developing their own compensatory measures. Learning from \\nthe experiences of other countries that have successfully navigated subsidy reform can provide valuable guidance. Indonesia, \\nfor instance, reduced fuel subsidies by over 90 percent between 2014 and 2016, sav ing billions of dollars in public spending \\n(Kojima, 2016). This reform was facilitated by low oil prices, effective communication, and social protection measures. \\nSimilarly, India phased out petrol and diesel subsidies gradually and replaced them with mark et-based pricing mechanisms. \\nThese experiences emphasize the importance of gradual adjustments, direct benefit transfers, and reallocating savings to vital \\nsectors like education, health, and infrastructure. \"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': './data/Evansetal.2023SubsidyRemoval.pdf', 'page': 18, 'page_label': '19'}, page_content=\"BIZECONS QUARTERLY 29 \\n \\n \\nIn the African context, Egypt embarked on a comprehensive fuel subsidy reform program, aiming to phase out all subsidies by \\n2022 (Eldeep & Zaki, 2023). The gradual approach, supported by social protection measures, showcases the potential for \\nachieving both fiscal sustainability and improved social welf are outcomes. Morocco's success in removing various fuel \\nsubsidies while implementing targeted compensation schemes highlights the importance of effective communication and \\naddressing the needs of the most vulnerable (Vidican & Loewe, 2023). \\nNigeria can dr aw from these success stories to develop its own compensatory measures and social welfare programs. Direct \\ncash transfers to poor households, conditional on their engagement in health, education, or employment programs, can \\nalleviate poverty and enhance hu man capital. Subsidizing public transportation, improving healthcare, education, and \\ninfrastructure, and addressing regional disparities can help utilize the savings from subsidy removal effectively. It is crucial to \\nrecognize that subsidy removal involves a trade-off between short-term benefits and long-term costs. Policymakers must weigh \\nthese factors while considering social welfare and economic efficiency.  \\n12.4 Limitations and Directions for Further Research \\nThe study's methodology, rooted in a case study approach, has allowed for an extensive exploration of the intricate effects o f \\nsubsidy removal on Nigeria's economy and society. Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognize inherent limitations in this approach. \\nWhile the in -depth analysis provides valuable insights, the single -case design may restrict the applicability of findings to \\ncontexts beyond Nigeria. Future research could adopt a multi -case approach, encompassing various countries that have \\nundergone subsidy removal, to uncover common trends and variations in impacts. \\nThe study's data collection and analysis, primarily utilizing qualitative methodologies and thematic analysis, have been \\ninstrumental in uncovering nuanced insights. However, the reliance  on secondary sources may introduce potential biases or \\ndata gaps. To enhance the empirical foundation, future research could employ mixed -method approaches that combine \\nqualitative data with quantitative indicators. Triangulating data sources, including p rimary data collection through surveys \\nand interviews, could bolster the credibility and depth of analysis. Additionally, extending the temporal scope beyond the 2023 \\nsubsidy removal and incorporating a more diverse range of stakeholder perspectives, parti cularly from marginalized groups, \\ncould yield a more comprehensive understanding of the impact. Further research directions could explore policy interventions, \\nemploy simulation models for optimal strategies, investigate the role of digital technologies, a nd conduct cross -country \\ncomparative studies. These efforts would enrich the study's findings and contribute to well -informed policymaking and \\nsustainable development. \\n \\nReferences \\nAbang, I. S., Elufisan, T. O., & Okwubunne , A. C.

These framew orks provide valuable insights into the complexities of subsidy removal, \\nshedding light on both anticipated and unintended consequences. \\nEconomic theories play a crucial role in understanding subsidy removal's economic implications. One such framework is the \\nRational Choice Theory, which posits that individuals act to maximize their self-interests within constraints (Van Valkengoed \\n& Van der Werff, 2022). In the context of subsidy removal, this theory can explain how consumers react to price increases by \\naltering their consumption patterns. Data from Nigeria's 2012 subsidy  removal protests reveals shifts in consumer behaviour \\ndue to sudden fuel price hikes (Apeloko & Olajide, 2012).  \\nPolitical theories offer insights into how government decisions on subsidy removal are influenced by power dynamics and \\npublic opinion. The Public Choice Theory argues that political actors aim to maximize their interests, leading to policies that \\nmay not always align with the public's welfare (Obasi et al., 2017). This theory can explain the rivalry between citizens' interests \\nand government decisions in both the 2012 and 2023 cases of subsidy removal in Nigeria.  \\nSocial theories illuminate the societal repercussions of subsidy removal. The Theory of Social Conflict explains how societal  \\ngroups with differing interests may engage in conflict when policies threaten their well -being (Apeloko & Olajide, 2012). The \\nTheory provides a lens through which an analysis of the tensions and clashes that arise when policies like subsidy removal have \\ndifferential impacts on various societal groups  can be carried out . It underscores the importance of considering not only the \\neconomic implications of such policies but also their social and distributional effects. By understanding these dynamics, \\npolicymakers can anticipate and address potential conflicts, striving for policy solutions that are more equitable and social ly \\nacceptable. \\nEnvironmental theories consider the ecological effects of subsidy removal, particularly relevant in the context of climate action. \\nThe theory of Ecological Modernization examines how policy shifts can lead to more sustainable practices, including reduced  \\nfossil fuel consumption (Van Valkengoed & Van der Werff, 2022).  The theory proposes that societies can transition toward \\ngreater environmental sustainability through a process of modernization that integrates ecological considerations into \\neconomic and policy decisions. It suggests that technological innovations, shifts in production methods, and changes in societal \\nvalues can collectively contribute to reducing environmental impacts. In the context of subsidy removal, this theory becomes \\nrelevant as it prompts a consideration of how the removal of subsidies on fossil fuels could incentivize the adoption of cleaner \\nenergy sources and more energy-efficient technologies. \\nIn short, a multi-dimensional analysis of subsidy removal necessitates the application of  various theories. Economic theories \\nilluminate market dynamics and consumer behaviour, social theories reveal societal implications, and environmental theories \\naddress ecological consequences. By integrating insights from these frameworks and grounding the analysis in empirical data, \\na comprehensive understanding of the 2023 subsidy removal case in Nigeria can be achieved. \\n \\n4 Methodology \\nDrawing inspiration from Rashid et al. (2019), who outline the case study method as a step -by-step guide for business \\nresearchers, this study employs a case study approach to dig deep into the multi -faceted impacts of subsidy removal on the \\nNigerian economy and society. This method is particularly suited to understanding complex real -life phenomena within their \\ncontextual settings. Data collection for this study is supported by qualitative research methodologies, primarily employing \\nthematic analysis. Braun and Clarke (2022) emphasize the significance of conceptual and design thinking in implementing \\nthematic analysis, promoti ng a structured approach to uncover patterns and meaning within the data. The utilization of \\nthematic analysis aligns with the study's aim of comprehensively exploring the multi -faceted impacts of subsidy removal on \\nthe Nigerian economy and society. \")"
