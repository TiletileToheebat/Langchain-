Hello!
My name is Toheebat, and I am excited to be a learner for this program, Generative AI.


I am a Data Scientist, aspiring Open-source Contributor, and Generative AI enthusiast with hands-on-project in the tech industry. For my career, I’m looking forward to build innovative products, solve real-world problems, and empower over 5,000 individuals to grow into better versions of themselves. My work and insights will also connect me with an audience of over 10,000 followers across social media platforms.
Looking ahead, my vision is to create groundbreaking projects and support millions—if not billions—of people in achieving their goals and thriving in the tech industry.


In this program, I am here to be guided of every step I take on the way, ensuring I have an unforgettable learning experience.
I'm embarking on this transformative journey with my peers!
